# Infrastructure Automation with Configuration Management

**Greeting all fellow dev, ops, infra, design, management, engineer, architect guys!**

Welcome to this repository! I'm excited to share my knowledge and resources on designing and developing robust Infrastructure Automation solutions, with a strong focus on leveraging Configuration Management tools.

With nearly two decades of experience in the industry, I've had the opportunity to work across diverse domains, including traditional infrastructure management, complex cloud migrations, and the setup and support of cutting-edge AI/ML services using platform services. This journey has provided me with a unique perspective on the evolving landscape of infrastructure and the critical role automation plays in driving efficiency, scalability, and innovation.

This repository aims to help you navigate this landscape by exploring powerful tools and techniques, including:

* **Puppet:** For declarative infrastructure configuration and management, ensuring consistency and reducing configuration drift.
* **GitHub:** For robust version control, seamless collaboration, and efficient management of our automation code, promoting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices.
* **Jenkins:** For building powerful CI/CD pipelines to automate infrastructure changes, enabling rapid, reliable, and repeatable deployments.
* **NGrok:** (Example) Demonstrating how to integrate tools for specific use cases, such as providing secure access to internal resources during automation processes.

A core focus of this repository is on achieving automated infrastructure management, including scheduled patching (e.g., yearly twice). This proactive approach minimizes manual intervention, enhances security posture, ensures compliance, and improves overall system stability.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository may contain:

* Practical Puppet code examples (manifests, modules) for configuring various infrastructure components.
* End-to-end Jenkins pipeline examples demonstrating the automation of infrastructure deployments and changes.
* Comprehensive guides and best practices for integrating GitHub into your infrastructure automation workflows.
* Detailed strategies for implementing scheduled automation for routine maintenance tasks like patching and updates.
* In-depth discussions on best practices, lessons learned, and real-world insights gained from my experience in infrastructure management, cloud migrations, and AI/ML service deployments.
* Examples of how to leverage platform services to streamline the setup and support of AI/ML infrastructure.

This repository is designed to be a valuable resource for both peers and those new to the field. I encourage active participation, feedback, and contributions to foster a collaborative learning environment. Let's work together to build more efficient, reliable, and intelligent infrastructure solutions.
